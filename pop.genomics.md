#estimate genetic diversity and divergence across the genome using pixy

#Basic filtering for population genomics include minimum allele frequency and low linkage disequilibrium
#I use plink for this

#run admixture


#in R
#average the proportion of admixture for individual populations

#run pca using snprelate

#plot pca differentiating wild and cultivated samples

#run abba-baba test to identify populations with evidence of gene flow with cultivated carrot

#back in r, run gradient forest models to identify the environmental variables that better explain introgression frequencies
